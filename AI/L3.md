# Informed and Uninformed search

Informed Search algorithms have information on the goal state which helps in more efficient searching.

Uninformed search algorithms have no additional information on the goal node other than the one provided in the problem definition. The plans to reach the goal state from the start state differ only by the order and length of actions.
