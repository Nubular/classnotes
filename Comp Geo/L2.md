# Convex Hull

## Linear combination of Vectors

$\alpha_i$x + $\beta_i$y

## Conic combination of Vectors

$\alpha_i$,$\beta_i$ >= 0

## Affine Combination of vectors

$\sum$$\alpha_i$ = 1

## convex combination

$\sum$$\alpha_i$ = 1 & $\alpha_i$ >= 0

## Definition

-   Convex subset of plane:
-   > A subset S of the plane is called conves iff for any pair or points p,q in S the line segment pq is completely contained in S.
-   Convex Hull:
-   > Def 1: CH(S) of a set S is the smallest convex set that contains S.
-   > Def 2: Intersection of all convex sets that contain S
-   > Def 3: It's the unique convex polygon whose vertices are points from P and that contains all points of P.
