# Pseudo Code

## Slow Convex Hull

Input: a set P of points in the plane.

Output: A list containing the vertices of CH(P) in clockwise order.

-   E $\leftarrow$ $\phi$
-   For all ordered pairs (p,q) in P x P with p not equal to q
    -   Do valid $\leftarrow$ true
    -   For all points r $\epsilon$ P not equal to p or q
        -   Do if r lies to the left of the directed line from p to q
            -   Then valid $\leftarrow$ false
    -   If valid then add the directed edge pq to E
-   From the set E of edges construct a list L of vertices CH(P) sorted in clockwise order.

## Condition in line 5

We can use signed area of $\Delta$PQR

> Note: for point comparison (if point is left of line) do not use floating point ops and comparison, since it can be inaccurate.

Use sign of above to find if to the left or right.

The determinant test is the most robust test of the above.

> If point r does now lie to the right or the left of the line pq, the case is called a degenerate case.
>
> We ignore the case since the points are in general position.
>
> **General Position**: Points are in general position means that no 3 or more points are collinear.

> A directed edge pq is an edge of Convex Hull if P iff all the other points of P lie either strictly to the right of the directed like pq, or they lie on the open line segment pq.
