-   Each map is a network of line segments.
-   Compute the intersection of two such networks.
-   Assume a single set of line segments and compute the intersections among the segments in that set.
-   Event point: End points and intersection points
-   The status changes when
    -   End points are encountered
    -   Intersection points are encountered.
