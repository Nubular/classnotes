## Proof of Lemma 1

-   Consider the sweep line above the intersection point p. $s_i$ must be adjacent along teh sweep line.
-   On the other hand in the beginning the status was empty and $s_i,s_j$ were not adjacent.
-   Hence there must be an even point after which $s_i,s_j$ became adjacent and are tested for intersection.

## Ordering criteria

Assumption: Non degenerate Line segments

-   Define an order A on the event points
-   p less than q iff
    -   $p_y > q_y$
    -   $p_y = q_y$ and $p_x < q_x$
-   Use a BBST Q ordered according to A.
-   Store with each event point p in Q the segments starting at p.

## Status

-   Operations of Status $\tau$
    -   Can give the neighbors of a given segment
    -   Insertion
    -   Deletion

### Data Structure

-   Store the segments intersecting the surrent sweep line ordered in the leaves of a balanced BST $\tau$.
-   Left to Right order of segments along the sweep line corresponds to left-to-right order of the leaves in $\tau$.
-   At each internal node, store the segment from the rightmost leaf in it's left subtree.

## Algorithm

Algorithm FindIntersections(S)

Input.A setSof line segments in the plane.

Output.The set of intersection points among the segments inS, with for
eachintersection point the segments that contain it.

1. Initialize an empty event queue $Q$. Next, insert the segment endpoints into $Q$; when an upper endpoint is inserted, the corresponding segment shouldbe stored with it.
2. Initialize an empty status structure $\tau$.
3. **while** $Q$ i s not empty
    1. **do** Determine the next event point $p$ in $Q$ and delete it.
        1. HandleEventPoint(p)
