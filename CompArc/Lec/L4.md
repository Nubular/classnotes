# Amdhal's Law

Execution time after improvement = Execution time Unaffected + Execution Time Affected/Rate of Improvement/Speedup

$T_b$ = Execution time (Before Improvement)

f = fraction that can be improved

$s_f$ = speedup

$T_a$ = After Improvement

$T_b = (1-f)T_b + fT_b$

$T_a = (1-f)T_b + \frac{fT_b}{S_f}$

$S_o = \frac{T_a}{T_b} = \frac{1}{(1-f) + \frac{f}{S_f}}$
