-   In mips each instr is 4 bytes(32 Bits). Program counter is always incremented by 4 every time
-   Values must be fetched from memory before any (add, sub) instructions are carried out on them.

-   Each Frame pointer is 64k
-   Frame pointer is fixed. Stack pointer moves.
-   stack pointer moves downwards/stack grows downwards.

# Mips instruction format

-   Instructions of 3 types: R(register) I(Immediate), J(Jump)

| Type |           |       |       | Format |               |       |
| ---- | --------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------------- | ----- |
| R    | opcode(6) | rs(5) | rt(5) | rd(5)  | shamt(5)      | funct |
| I    | opcode(6) | rs(5) | rt(5) |        | immediate(16) |       |
| J    | opcode(6) |       |       |        | address(26)   |       |

-   opcode - operation code
-   rs - register source
-   rt - register target
-   rd - register destination
-   shamt - shift amount
-   funct - function code

## How to convert 26 bit address to 32 bit address.

-   place 2 00's in the LSB => 28 bits
-   pad the beginning with the first four bits of program counter.

## To load >16 Bit values in immediate

-   Unconditional Jump -> J-Type instruction
-   Conditional Jump -> I-Type instruction
-   Conditional Jumps are usually used in loops and if statements.

-   for J type instructions the address in the code is actually the memory address/4
-   Hence the value of address is 20000 not 80000
-   For I type, the number specified is relative to the program counter and you start from the next address.
-   The next instr after bne is addi, Exit is 2 addresses after this. Hence you put 2 there instead. In terms of address: 8016 + 2\*4 = 8024.
