## Branching Far

-   Most conditional jumps are to a nearby location
-   Assembler splits command into two
-   Steps

    -   Inserts an unconditional jump to branch target.
    -   Inverts the condition so that the branches decide to whether to skip a jump

            Eg beq $s0, $s1, L1 replaced by
            bne beq $s0, $s1, L2
            j L1
            L2:

## Addressing Modes

-   Immediate addressing: where the operand is a constant withing the instruction.
-   Register addressing: Operand is register.
-   Base or displacement addressing: Where the operand is at the memory location whose address is the sum of a register and a constand in the instruction.
-   PC relative: Where branch address is the sumc of PC and a constant in instr.
-   Pseudo relative: Where jump address is the 26 bits of the instruction concatenated with the upper bits of PC. Append first 4 bits of program counter.
    -   Max bytes that can be travelled 2^28, first 4 bits of PC can't be changed. This is why you can't place a program across a macro block, PC changes and address can't be resolved.

## Mips convention

-   Caller saved reg: are used to hold temporary quantities that need not be preserved across calls.
-   Saved registers: Callee saved registers, are used to hold long-lived values that should be preserved across calls.
-   \$vx: for function return values.
-   \$tx: caller saved registers
-   \$sx: calee saved registers.

-   Caller at call time
    -   put args in \$a0-\$a3
    -   save any save any caller-save temporaries \$tx
    -   jal \$ra
-   Callee at entry
    -   Allocate stack space
    -   save \$ra,\$s0-\$s7 if necessary.
-   Callee at exit
    -   restore $ra, $sx
    -   Deallocate all stack space
    -   put all return values
-   Caller after return
-   -   retrieve return values from \$vx
-   -   restore \$tx
