## Keywords

-   Data Standardation/Normalization :
    -   **Normalization** typically means rescales the values into a range of [0,1].
    -   **Standardization** typically means rescales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (unit variance).
-   Learning Data: Data used to train the model.
-   Testing Data: Data used to test the accuracy of the model after training.

## Keywords

-   Features/Attributes/Predictors: An individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed.

    -   Example: Features for the price of a second-hand car:
        -   Date of Manufacture
        -   Engine Capacity
        -   Condition of car
        -   Mileage

-   Response/Target: Final attributes which needs to be reached.

    -   Example: For the above scenario the target can be the price of the car.

-   Supervised Learning: Trying to find the relation between the target attribute and the feature attrubutes.
    -   Classification problems: When target attribute can take discrete values/finite number of values.
        -   Example: Hand written digit recognition, Whether a patient has a particular disease or not, Email spam detection.
    -   Regression problem: Target attributes can take a range of values.
        -   Example: Predicting house/stock market price.
-   Unsupervised Learning:
