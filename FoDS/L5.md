# Mean Variance and Standard Deviation

The mean of a discrete random variabls is the weighted average of all its values. The weights are the probabilities.

Expected value
; $E(x) = \mu = \Sigma x P(x)$

Variance: $V(x) = \sigma^2 = \Sigma (x-\mu)^2 P(x)$

Standard deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{V(x)}$
