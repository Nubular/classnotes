# Shells

Provides an interface to the unix system. It gathers intput from the user and executes programs based on that input. Once executed is displays the output.

Two major types of shells:

-   Bourne shell - \$ symbol is shown in the terminal.
-   C type shell

# User Interfaces

-   Desktop interfaces
-   Touchscreen Interfaces

# System Calls

-   Programming interface to services provided by OS.
-   Accessed by programms via a high-level api.
-   Examples:
    -   Win32 api
    -   POISX (Linux and OSX)
    -   Java api for JVM

## Implementation

-   Each Syscall is associated with a number.
    The System-call interface maintains a table indexed according to there numbers.

-   The system call interface will invoke the intended syscall and returns the status and any other return values.

-   The syscall interface abstracts the implementation from the program.

## Parameter passing

-   One usually needs to pass more than just the identity of the system call
-   General methods to pass params:
    -   Pass parameters in registers
        -   Params may be more than number of registers
    -   Store params in a block or table in memory and pass address of block as a param in register.
        -   Approach taken by Linux & Solaris
    -   Params pushed into the stack by program an popped my OS.

Block and stack methods are not limited by memory.

## Types of syscalls

-   Process Control
-   File management
-   Device management
-   Protection & Security
-   Information maintenance
