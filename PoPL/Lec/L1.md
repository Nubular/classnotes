# Programming Domanins

-   System Programming
    -   Unix(?)
-   Web Development
    -   Python, php, js

# Factors for a good programming language

-   Readability

    -   Orthogonality

        -   > Means "Changing A does not change B". An example of an orthogonal system would be a radio, where changing the station does not change the volume and vice-versa.
        -   > In programming languages this means that when you execute an instruction, nothing but that instruction happens (very important for debugging).
        -   > sir def: Having a small number of primitive structures used to build things, too many of which can lead to misuse of the features and unintended outcomes.

    -   Overall Simplicity
    -   Data Types

-   Writabliity
    -   Simplicity and orthogonality
    -   Abstraction
        -   Pre-defining stuff abstracts the complexity of implementation
        -   Reduces bugs.
        -   Ex: Cpp STL
    -   Expressivity
-   Reliablity

    -   Type checking
    -   Exception handling
        -   Allows programmer to decide how errors are resolved rather than crashing the program.
    -   Aliasing
        -   Refers to the situation where the same memory location can be accessed using different names.
        -   Avoided by most modern languages.
    -   Readability and Writability

-   Cost
    -   Training
    -   Creating SW
    -   Compilation cost
    -   Execution cost
        -   There is a tradeoff b/w compilation cost vs execution cost. Compiler optimization can be used to Reduce execution time at the cost of increased compilation time.
    -   Maintainance
    -   Cost of language implementation system.
        -   The reason java is so popular is because free compiler/interpreter system became available soon after it's release.

# What influences the language design?

-   Computer Architecture

    -   Von Neumann Architecture
        ![Von Neumann Arch](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Von_Neumann_Architecture.svg)

-   Programming design methodologies
    -   Procedure oriented paradigm
    -   Data Oriented paradigm
    -   Object oriented paradigm
    -   Concurrent programming (Multi-threading)(Not sure this belongs here)

# Language Categories

-   Imperative languages
-   Functional languages
-   Logic languages
    -   rule based language
-   Scripting languages (js, php)
-   Mark-up Languages (HTML, XML)
    -   Adds additonal instruction on how content should be displayed

# Language Design trade-offs

-   Writability vs Readability (Pointers, Large no of operators)
-   Reliablity vc cost of execution (ex Array bound check)
-   Compilation cost vs Execution cost
