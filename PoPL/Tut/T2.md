Write a program to copy the content from one file (test.txt) to another (temp.txt) which are in the same directory.

```c
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    FILE *fptr1, *fptr2;
    char filename[100], file[100];
    scanf("%s", filename);
    fptr1 = fopen(filename, "r");
    fptr2 = fopen("text", "w");
    char c = fgetc(fptr1);
    while (c != EOF)
    {
        fputc(c, fptr2);
        c = fgetc(fptr1);
    }
    fclose(fptr1);
    fclose(fptr2);
}
```

```java
    import java.io.BufferedReader;
    import java.io.FileReader;
    import java.io.FileWriter;
    import java.io.IOException;

    public class FileCopyExample {

    	public static void main(String[] args) {

    		try {
    			FileReader fr = new FileReader("input.txt");
    			BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);
    			FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("output.txt", true);
    			String s;

    			while ((s = br.readLine()) != null) {
    				fw.write(s);
    				fw.flush();
    			}
    			br.close();
    			fw.close();
                            System.out.println("file copied");
    		} catch (IOException e) {
    			e.printStackTrace();
    		}
    	}
    }
```

## Why are some languages more propular than others.

-   It takes time to learn a programming language.
-   Too many sophisticated features that confuse developers.
-   Poor documentation and community support.
-   When a programmer is experienced enough, they are more committed to solving problem rather then learning new languages.

## Revising a language

-   add new features
    -   While doing this one must maintain backward compatibility.
    -   There is usually a trade of between adding new features and maintaining back wards compatibility.
    -   Can result in some functions/libraries being deprecated.
