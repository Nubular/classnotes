# Languages

Languages consist of a set of symbols.

> The words in a language can be defined as a powerset of alphabet. This is incorrect, since a powerset does not contain repeated elements.

## String

Finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet.
010101010000 is a string over the binary alphabet {0,1}
