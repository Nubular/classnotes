# Kleene star

Denoted by L\*. It is the set of all strings obtained by concatenating zero or more strins from L.The concatenation of zero strings is e, and the concatenation of one string is the string itself.

> $L^* = { w \epsilon \Sigma^* : w = w_1 \circ w_2 \circ ... w_k for\ some\ k\geq 0\ and\ some\ w_1...w_k \epsilon L}$

L = {01, 1, 100}, then 110001110011 E L\*,
since 110001110011 = $1\circ 0\circ 100001\circ 0\circ 1\circ 0\circ 1000\circ 1\circ 0\circ 1$, and each of these strings is in L.

Note that if $\phi^* = \{e\}$ then $L^* = \{e\}$

# Regular Expression

-   Describes a language by means of single symbols, $\phi, \cup$, parentheses and \*.
-   We use Regular Expressions as a means of representing certain subsets of strings over $\Sigma$.
-   Used to describe languages that consist of a set of strings.
-   They describe languages exclusively by means of single symbols and $\cup$ and \*.
-   They are useful for representing certain sets of strings in algebraic fashion.
-   These describe strings accepted by FA.
-   Only $\Sigma^* \cup$ {(,), 0, U,\*} are used in RE's.
-   Every RE represents a language.

The regular expressions over an alphabet $\Sigma*$ are all strings over the alphabet $\Sigma^* \cup$ {(,), 0, U,\*}

## Conditions for a valid RE

## Lambda function

-   The relationship between RE and a language is established by a function $L$, such that if $\alpha$ is a RE the $L(\alpha)$ is a language represented by $\alpha$. That is $L$ is a function from strings to languages.

-   $L(\phi) = \phi$ The LHS $\phi$ is a RE, RHS $\phi$ is an empty set.
-   $L(a) = \{a\}$ for each a of $\Sigma$
-   If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are REs then $L((\alpha\beta)) = L(\alpha) L(\beta)$
-   If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are REs then $L((\alpha\cup\beta)) = L(\alpha) \cup L(\beta)$
-   If $\alpha$ is an RE then $L((\alpha*)) = L(\alpha) *$

> Example:
> $\Sigma = \{a,b,c,d\}$
>
> x = {a,b} y={c,d}
>
> $L(xy) = L(x)L(y) = \{a,b\}\{c,d\} = \{ac,ad,bc,bd\}$
