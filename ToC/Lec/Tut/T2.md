$L((a\cup b)*) = L((a \cup b))* = (L(a) \cup L(b)) = (\{a\} \cup \{b\})* = \{a,b\}* = \{e,a,b,aa,ab,bb,ba\}$

### Important

$(a \cup b)* = (a \cup b) ( a \cup \phi) = \{a,b\}\{a,\phi\} = \{a,b,aa,ba\}$

### Questions

if $\Sigma$ = {1,0}, give a RE for the language containing strings starting with two zeros and followed by any number of 1's including 0 number of 1s

> 001\*

if $\Sigma$ = {1,0}, give a RE for the language containing strings starting with 0 and followed by any number of 1s including zero number of 1s, and then immediately ending with two zeros

> 01\*00

if $\Sigma$ = {1,0}, give a RE for the language containing strings formed on {0,1}, including empty strings.

> (0 \cup 1)\*

Starting with 1 and ending with one, and any combination of 0s and 1s in between

> $(1 (0\cup1)*1)$

Starting with zeros( atleast 2) followed by optional 1. Valid strings are 00, 00001,00000

> $(00)0*(1\cup \phi)$

An L over $\Sigma$={0,1} is {001,11,10}
What is the RE for L.
Check if following expressions are valid L\*:

-   001110
-   111000111
-   101000110
-   100011100

> RE: (001 U 11 U 10) or (1 (0 U 1) U (001))
> B,C valid boi

L(a* ab) = L(a*)L(ab) = L(a*) L(a)L(b) = {a*}{a}{b}
